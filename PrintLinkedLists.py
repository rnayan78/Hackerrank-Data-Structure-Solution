his challenge is part of a MyCodeSchool tutorial track and is accompanied by a video lesson.

If you're new to linked lists, this is a great exercise for learning about them. Given a pointer to the head node of a linked list, print its elements in order, one element per line. If the head pointer is null (indicating the list is empty), donâ€™t print anything.

Input Format

The first line of input contains , the number of elements in the linked list.
The next  lines contain one element each, which are the elements of the linked list.

Note: Do not read any input from stdin/console. Complete the printLinkedList function in the editor below.

Constraints

, where  is the  element of the linked list.
Output Format

Print the integer data for each element of the linked list to stdout/console (e.g.: using printf, cout, etc.). There should be one element per line.
